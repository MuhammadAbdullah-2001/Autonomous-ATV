# Autonomous-ATV
Undergraduate Final Year project

## Abstract
This thesis presents the design and development of an autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) based on a full-scale 110 cc All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) platform. Leveraging a simulation-first methodology using Gazebo, PX4, and ROS 2, the project validates a Pure Pursuit path-tracking controller in MATLAB, accounting for throttle nonlinearity and realistic vehicle dynamics. The hardware architecture integrates Pixhawk 5X, Arduino Nano, servos, and an Electric Power Steering (EPS) module, with real-time GPS navigation via the Here 3 module and QGroundControl. Field trials on sandy terrain confirm robust waypoint-following and off-road capability.
